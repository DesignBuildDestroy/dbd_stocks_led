Raspberry PI Zero W based lamp of sorts that changes color based on the selected Stock's current price difference and displays the details on an OLED screen. Using 2 capacitive touch sensors you can scroll through the stock symbols in your list. Uses Finhub.IO PI to pull real-time stock quotes. At the heart of this project is a Raspberry PI Zero W, Adafruit Jewel 7 (plenty bright) and an Adafruit PiOLED 128x32 display.

## Features
- OLED Display for actual Stock spot price, change in value, and symbol.
- NeoPixel Jewel 7 to create a fading effect, red or green depending if the current days change is positive or negative
- Faster fade indicates the stock is greater than 3% up or down.
- Capacitive touch sensors mounted to enclosure to scroll backwards and forwards through stock list

Can be adapted to work for anything you want a visual indication of like current weather or scrolling through 5 day forecast. 

## Components
- Raspberry Pi Zero W
- Adafruit NeoPixel Jewel 7
- Adafruit PiOLED 128x32 display
- 2 TTP223 Capacitive Touch sensors (These are much smaller than the 223A blue board)
